                question: "Write a program to swap two numbers without using a third variable.",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>You can swap two numbers without a third variable using arithmetic operations or bitwise XOR.</p>
<p><b>Using Arithmetic Operations (Java):</b></p>
<pre>
public class SwapNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        a = a + b;
        b = a - b;
        a = a - b;
        System.out.println("a: " + a + ", b: " + b);
    }
}
</pre>
<p><b>Using Bitwise XOR (Java):</b></p>
<pre>
public class SwapNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 20;
        a = a ^ b;
        b = a ^ b;
        a = a ^ b;
        System.out.println("a: " + a + ", b: " + b);
    }

                question: "What is the difference between an array and a linked list?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Memory Allocation:</b> Arrays have contiguous memory allocation, while linked lists have non-contiguous memory allocation.</li>
    <li><b>Element Access:</b> Elements in an array can be accessed randomly using an index. In a linked list, you have to traverse the list from the beginning to access an element.</li>
    <li><b>Insertion/Deletion:</b> Insertion and deletion of elements are faster in a linked list than in an array, as it doesn't require shifting of elements.</li>
</ul>

                question: "Tell me about your final year project.",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer Structure:</b></p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Project Goal:</b> Start by explaining the problem your project was trying to solve.</li>
    <li><b>Your Specific Role:</b> Describe your individual contribution to the project. Were you responsible for the backend, frontend, database, or a specific module?</li>
    <li><b>The Technology Stack Used:</b> List the technologies you used (e.g., Java, Python, React, etc.) and explain why you chose them.</li>
    <li><b>The Biggest Challenge You Faced:</b> Talk about a specific technical challenge you encountered and how you overcame it. This demonstrates your problem-solving skills.</li>

                question: "What is a deadlock?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>A deadlock is a situation where two or more competing actions are waiting for the other to finish, and thus neither ever does. In a database or operating system, a deadlock occurs when two or more processes are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release a resource.</p>

                question: "What is the use of the `static` keyword in Java?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>The `static` keyword in Java is used to create class-level variables and methods. This means that the variable or method belongs to the class itself, not to any specific instance of the class.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Static Variables:</b> Also known as class variables, they are shared among all instances of the class.</li>
    <li><b>Static Methods:</b> Can be called without creating an instance of the class. They can only access static variables and other static methods.</li>
</ul>
