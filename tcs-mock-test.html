                question: "Write a program to check if a number is prime.",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>An optimized way to check if a number is prime is to iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime.</p>
<p><b>Code (Java):</b></p>
<pre>
public class PrimeCheck {
    public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

                question: "What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Method Overloading:</b> This is an example of compile-time polymorphism. It occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different number of arguments, or different types of arguments).</li>
    <li><b>Method Overriding:</b> This is an example of run-time polymorphism. It occurs when a subclass has a method with the same name, parameters, and return type as a method in its superclass. The method in the subclass overrides the method in the superclass.</li>
</ul>

            {
                question: "What are the ACID properties in a database?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>ACID properties are a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Atomicity:</b> Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all of its operations are executed, or none of them are.</li>
    <li><b>Consistency:</b> Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.</li>
    <li><b>Isolation:</b> Ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.</li>
    <li><b>Durability:</b> Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a power loss, crashes, or errors.</li>
</ul>

                question: "What is a foreign key?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p>A foreign key is a key used to link two tables together. It is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the parent table.</p>

                question: "What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize in Java?",
                answer: `
<p><b>Answer:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li><b>final:</b> A keyword that can be applied to classes, methods, and variables. A final class cannot be inherited, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable cannot be changed.</li>
    <li><b>finally:</b> A block that is used in a try-catch statement. The finally block is always executed, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.</li>
    <li><b>finalize:</b> A method that is called by the garbage collector just before an object is garbage collected. It can be used to perform cleanup operations.</li>
