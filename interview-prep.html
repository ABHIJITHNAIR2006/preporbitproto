                    <mock-test-details question="What is the difference between an array and a linked list?" answer="<p><b>Array:</b> An array is a data structure that stores elements of the same type in contiguous (touching) memory locations.</p><ul><b>Pros:</b><li>Fast random access (you can jump to index $i$ instantly, $O(1)$) because its position can be calculated (base address + $i$ * size of element).</li></ul><ul><b>Cons:</b><li>Fixed size (in most static languages). Inserting or deleting elements in the middle is slow ($O(n)$) because you have to shift other elements.</li></ul><p><b>Linked List:</b> A linked list is a data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains the data and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The nodes can be stored anywhere in memory.</p><ul><b>Pros:</b><li>Dynamic size. Insertion and deletion are fast ($O(1)$) if you already have a pointer to the node.</li></ul><ul><b>Cons:</b><li>No random access (you must traverse the list from the beginning to get to the $n$-th element, $O(n)$). Requires extra memory for pointers.</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="Explain Big O notation with a simple example." answer="<p>Big O notation is used to describe the time or space complexity of an algorithm—how the runtime or memory usage grows as the input size ($n$) increases. It describes the worst-case scenario.</p><ul><li><b>$O(1)$ (Constant Time):</b> Always takes the same amount of time, regardless of input size.<br><b>Example:</b> Accessing an element in an array by its index (my_array[5]).</li><li><b>$O(n)$ (Linear Time):</b> Runtime grows linearly with the input size.<br><b>Example:</b> Iterating through every element in a list one time to find a value.</li><li><b>$O(n^2)$ (Quadratic Time):</b> Runtime grows quadratically. Very slow for large inputs.<br><b>Example:</b> A nested loop where you compare every element to every other element.</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is a hash table? Why is it fast for lookups?" answer="<p>A hash table (or hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array, mapping keys to values.</p><p>It\'s fast for lookups ($O(1)$ on average) because it uses a hash function.</p><p>When you add a (key, value) pair, the hash function takes the key and computes an index (a “hash”).</p><p>The value is then stored at that index in an array (or “bucket”).</p><p>When you want to look up the value for a key, it re-runs the same hash function on the key, gets the same index, and immediately finds the value stored there. This avoids searching the entire data structure.</p><p>(Note: Sometimes two different keys can hash to the same index, which is called a collision. This is often handled by storing a linked list at that index, which is why the worst-case lookup can be $O(n)$).</p>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="Write a function to find the $n$-th Fibonacci number." answer="<p>The Fibonacci sequence is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.</p><h4>Recursive Solution (Simple, but Inefficient):</h4><p>This solution is elegant but very slow ($O(2^n)$) because it re-calculates the same values many times.</p><p><b>Python:</b></p><pre><code>def fib_recursive(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n    return fib_recursive(n - 1) + fib_recursive(n - 2)</code></pre><p><b>Java:</b></p><pre><code>public int fibRecursive(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) {\n        return n;\n    }\n    return fibRecursive(n - 1) + fibRecursive(n - 2);\n}</code></pre><h4>Iterative Solution (Fast and Efficient):</h4><p>This solution is much faster ($O(n)$) and uses less memory ($O(1)$ space). It\'s the preferred approach in an interview.</p><p><b>Python:</b></p><pre><code>def fib_iterative(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return n\n\n    a, b = 0, 1\n    for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return b</code></pre><p><b>Java:</b></p<pre><code>public int fibIterative(int n) {\n    if (n <= 1) {\n        return n;\n    }\n\n    int a = 0, b = 1;\n    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {\n        int temp = b;\n        b = a + b;\n        a = temp;\n    }\n    return b;\n}</code></pre>"></mock-test-details>

                    <h2 class="topic-title">Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</h2>
                    <mock-test-details question="What are the four pillars of OOPs?" answer="<ul><li><b>Encapsulation:</b> The bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, or “class.” It also involves restricting direct access to some of an object\'s components (using private variables), which is a key part of data hiding.</li><li><b>Abstraction:</b> Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This simplifies how objects are used. (Example: You press the “on” button on a TV, you don\'t need to know how the circuitry works).</li><li><b>Inheritance:</b> The mechanism by which one class (the “child” or “subclass”) can acquire the properties and methods of another class (the “parent” or “superclass”). This promotes code reuse.</li><li><b>Polymorphism:</b> The ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows a single action (like a method name) to be performed in different ways by different objects. (Example: A shape.draw() method can draw a Circle, a Square, or a Triangle.)</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?" answer="<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>Abstract Class</th><th>Interface</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Methods</td><td>Can have both abstract (no body) and concrete (with body) methods.</td><td>Can only have abstract methods (before Java 8/C# 8).</td></tr><tr><td>Variables</td><td>Can have instance variables (fields) of any type (final, non-final, static, etc.).</td><td>Can only have public static final constants (variables are implicitly final).</td></tr><tr><td>Inheritance</td><td>A class can extend only one abstract class.</td><td>A class can implement multiple interfaces.</td></tr><tr><td>Purpose</td><td>To provide a common base implementation and share code among related classes. (An “is-a” relationship).</td><td>To define a “contract” of methods that a class must implement. (A “can-do” relationship).</td></tr></tbody></table>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is method overloading vs. method overriding?" answer="<h4>Method Overloading (Compile-time Polymorphism):</h4><p>This is when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (e.g., different number of arguments, different types of arguments, or both). The compiler decides which one to call based on the arguments provided.</p><p><b>Java Example:</b></p><pre><code>class Calculator {\n    int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }\n    double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }\n}</code></pre><h4>Method Overriding (Run-time Polymorphism):</h4><p>This is when a subclass (child class) provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass (parent class). The method signature (name and parameters) must be the same. This allows the subclass to “override” the parent\'s behavior.</p><p><b>Java Example:</b></p><pre><code>class Animal {\n    void makeSound() { System.out.println(\"Generic animal sound\"); }\n}\n\nclass Dog extends Animal {\n    @Override\n    void makeSound() { System.out.println(\"Woof\"); }\n}</code></pre>"></mock-test-details>

                    <mock-test-details question="What are the ACID properties in a database?" answer="<p>ACID properties guarantee that database transactions are processed reliably:</p><ul><li><b>Atomicity:</b> The entire transaction is treated as a single, “all or nothing” unit. If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is rolled back, and the database is left unchanged.</li><li><b>Consistency:</b> A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It ensures that any data written to the database is valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, and triggers.</li><li><b>Isolation:</b> Ensures that multiple transactions running concurrently do not interfere with each other. The result of concurrent transactions is the same as if they were executed one after another (serially).</li><li><b>Durability:</b> Once a transaction has been successfully committed, the changes are permanent, even in the event of a system failure (like a power outage or crash).</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is the difference between a PRIMARY KEY and a UNIQUE KEY?" answer="<table><thead><tr><th>Feature</th><th>PRIMARY KEY</th><th>UNIQUE KEY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Null Values</td><td>Cannot contain NULL values.</td><td>Can contain one or more NULL values (depending on the specific RDBMS).</td></tr><tr><td>Number per Table</td><td>Only one PRIMARY KEY is allowed per table.</td><td>A table can have multiple UNIQUE KEYs.</td></tr><tr><td>Purpose</td><td>To uniquely identify every row in the table.</td><td>To ensure that all values in a column (or set of columns) are unique.</td></tr><tr><td>Clustering</td><td>By default, it creates a clustered index (data is physically sorted by this key).</td><td>By default, it creates a non-clustered index.</td></tr></tbody></table>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="Write an SQL query to find the second-highest salary from an employees table." answer="<p>This is a common and reliable way using OFFSET and LIMIT.</p><pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT salary\nFROM employees\nORDER BY salary DESC\nLIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;</code></pre><p><b>Explanation:</b></p><ul><li><b>ORDER BY salary DESC:</b> Sorts all salaries from highest to lowest.</li><li><b>DISTINCT:</b> Ensures we only get unique salary values (in case multiple people have the same salary).</li><li><b>LIMIT 1:</b> Says we only want one row back.</li><li><b>OFFSET 1:</b> Says to skip the first row (which is the highest salary), giving us the second-highest.</li></ul><p><b>Alternative (Subquery):</b></p><pre><code>SELECT MAX(salary)\nFROM employees\nWHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);</code></pre>"></mock-test-details>

                    <h2 class="topic-title">Core Concepts (OS & Networks)</h2>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is the difference between a process and a thread?" answer="<p><b>Process:</b> A process is a program in execution (e.g., opening Google Chrome). Each process has its own private memory space (address space), code, and resources (like file handles). Processes are heavyweight and are isolated from each other.</p><p><b>Thread:</b> A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. A single process can have multiple threads running concurrently (e.g., one Chrome thread for the UI, one for network requests). Threads share the same memory space and resources as their parent process. They are lightweight, making them faster to create and switch between than processes.</p>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is a deadlock and how can you prevent it?" answer="<p>A deadlock is a situation where two or more processes (or threads) are blocked forever, each waiting for a resource that is held by another process in the same group.</p><p><b>Example:</b> Process A locks Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2. Process B locks Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1. Neither can proceed.</p><p><b>Prevention Strategies:</b></p><ul><li><b>Mutual Exclusion (Avoidance):</b> Make resources shareable (not always possible).</li><li><b>Hold and Wait (Avoidance):</b> Ensure a process requests all its required resources at once, and doesn\'t hold some while waiting for others.</li><li><b>No Preemption (Prevention):</b> If a process is waiting, allow the system to forcibly take its held resources away (preempt it).</li><li><b>Circular Wait (Prevention):</b> Impose a total ordering on all resource types. Require each process to request resources in an increasing order of enumeration (e.g., always request Resource 1 before Resource 2).</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="Briefly explain the TCP/IP model." answer="<p>The TCP/IP model is a 4-layer conceptual model that standardizes how computers communicate over a network (like the internet).</p><ul><li><b>Layer 4: Application Layer (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP)</b><br>This is where applications (like your web browser) create and understand data. It defines the protocols for specific tasks.</li><li><b>Layer 3: Transport Layer (e.g., TCP, UDP)</b><br>This layer manages the connection between devices.<ul><li><b>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)</b> is reliable and connection-oriented. It ensures all packets arrive in order and without errors (like for a file download).</li><li><b>UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</b> is fast and connectionless. It just sends packets without guaranteeing delivery (like for video streaming or online games).</li></ul></li><li><b>Layer 2: Internet Layer (e.g., IP, ICMP)</b><br>This layer is responsible for addressing and routing packets to their destination across different networks. The IP (Internet Protocol) address is used here.</li><li><b>Layer 1: Network Access/Link Layer (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi)</b><br>This is the physical hardware layer that handles the actual transmission of data bits over the physical medium (like cables or radio waves). It deals with MAC addresses.</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>

Use this structure:</p><ul><li><b>Present (Who you are):</b> “I am a final-year Computer Science student at [Your University] specializing in [Your Specialization, e.g., \'backend development and cloud technologies\'].”</li><li><b>Past (How you got here):</b> “Over the past two years, I\'ve focused on building practical skills. I interned at [Company Name], where I worked on a live project using Node.js and AWS, which solidified my passion for scaling applications. I also built a personal project, [Project Name], to [solve a problem], which taught me [a key skill].”</li><li><b>Future (Why you are here):</b> “I\'ve been following [This Company\'s Name] and am deeply impressed by [specific product/value, e.g., \'your work in the AI-driven logistics space\']. My goal is to apply my skills in [Skill 1] and [Skill 2] to contribute to a challenging, impactful product, and I see a perfect fit here.”</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="Tell me about a challenging project you worked on." answer="<p>Use the STAR method to structure your answer clearly.</p><ul><li><b>S (Situation):</b> “In my final-year project, our team of three was tasked with building a \'TriageNow\' web application for a hackathon. The goal was to take user symptoms and recommend a care path.”</li><li><b>T (Task):</b> “My specific responsibility was to build the backend logic and connect it to a third-party medical API. The main challenge was that the API documentation was poor, and we had a strict 48-hour deadline.”</li><li><b>A (Action):</b> “First, I used Postman to send dozens of test requests to the API, carefully documenting the actual responses, not what the documentation claimed. I discovered several undocumented error codes. Second, I built a \'service\' layer in our Node.js app to act as a buffer. This \'adapter\' pattern translated our app\'s simple requests into the complex format the API required, and it gracefully handled the errors I had found. This kept our main codebase clean.”</li><li><b>R (Result):</b> “As a result, we successfully integrated the API in under 12 hours. Our app was one of the few at the hackathon with a fully functional external integration. We won \'Best Use of API\' and delivered a working prototype that accurately routed mock patient symptoms.”</li></ul>"></mock-test-details>
                    <mock-test-details question="What is your biggest weakness?" answer="<p>The key is to be genuine, self-aware, and show you are proactive.</p><p>State a real, work-related weakness (but not a fatal flaw, e.g., don\'t say “I can\'t code” or “I hate teamwork”).</p><p>Good examples: “I tend to be overly critical of my own work,” “I sometimes get too focused on small details, which can slow me down,” or “I used to be hesitant to ask for help, trying to solve everything myself.”</p><p>Provide a specific example.</p><p>“In a previous project, I spent hours trying to fix a complex bug on my own because I didn\'t want to \'bother\' the senior developers.”</p><p>Show the steps you are actively taking to improve.</p><p>“I realized this was inefficient. Now, I use a \'30-minute rule.\' If I\'m stuck on a problem for 30 minutes, I write down exactly what I\'ve tried, and then I reach out to a teammate or mentor. This has made me more collaborative and much more efficient, and I\'ve learned that most people are happy to help.”</p>"></mock-test-details>
